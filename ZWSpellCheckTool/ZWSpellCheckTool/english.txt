fairly
NOTE ON USAGE 用法: The adverbs fairly, quite, rather and pretty can all mean `moderately', `to some extent' or `not very' and are used to alter the strength of adjectives and adverbs. *fairly、 quite、 rather、 pretty这几个副词均可表示｀适度地＇、 ｀在某种程度上＇或｀不很＇的意思, 常用以改变所修饰的形容词或副词的分量. Fairly is the weakest and pretty the strongest and most informal, but their effect is very much influenced by intonation. *fairly词义最弱而pretty词义最强, 也最通俗, 但词义的强弱受语调的影响很大. Generally, the more any of these adverbs is stressed, the more negative the sentence sounds. 一般说来, 这类副词读得越重, 句子听起来否定含义就越强.  1 When rather or pretty is used with a positive quality, it can sound enthusiastic *rather或pretty与褒义词连用时, 听起来心情愉快: a rather/pretty good play 一出相 当好的戏. With a negative or variable quality they express disapproval 这两个词与贬义词或可褒可贬的词连用时, 表示不赞成或不满意: rather/pretty poor work 相当差的工作 *  I'm rather/pretty warm. 我很热. *  It's rather/pretty small/big. 这可太小[大]了.  2 Fairly is mostly used with positive qualities *fairly多与褒义词连用: fairly tidy, spacious, friendly, etc 挺整洁、 宽敞、热情等 (compare 试比较: rather untidy, cramped, unfriendly, etc 很零乱、 狭窄、 冷淡等).  3 Only rather can be used with comparative expressions and too 只有rather可与比较级的词语和too连用: The house is rather bigger than we thought. 这所房子比我们想的大得多. *  These shoes are rather too small. 这双鞋未免太小了.  4 Rather and quite can precede the indefinite article when followed by an adjective + noun *rather和quite与｀不定冠词+形容词+名词＇连用时, 可置於不定冠词之前: rather/quite a nice day 十分晴朗的一天 *  a rather/quite/fairly/pretty nice day 十分晴朗的一天.

Compare non-British (`of a nationality which is not British') andun-British (`being disloyal to Britain'). 试比较non-British（非英国籍的）和un-British（不忠於英国的）.  2 In- is used with fewer words than un-, also to form opposites. *in-也用以构成反义词, 但能与之结合的词较un-少些. There are variant spellings 这一前缀有几种拼写形式: il- before l (illogical); im- before b, m, p (imbalance, immaterial, impossible) and ir- before r (irresponsible).*il-用於l之前（illogical）; im-用於b、 m、 p之前（imbalance、 immaterial、 impossible）; ir-用於r之前（irresponsible）.  3 Dis- is also used with verbs, adjectives and nouns to form opposites *dis-亦用於动词、 形容词、 名词之前, 构成反义词: dislike 不喜欢 * disobedient 不服从的 * distrust 不信任.  4 A- is mostly used in formal or technical words to indicate `lacking in' or `lack of' *a-主要用在较文的词或科技词之前, 表示｀缺乏＇或｀无＇: amorphous (`lacking in shape') 无定形的 * anarchy (`lack of rule') 无政府状态.  5 It is not possible to predict whether un-, in- or dis- is used with a particular word and the correct form must be noted and learned 一个词的前缀究竟是用un-、 in-还是dis-是没有固定规律可循的, 只好留心逐一记住.

NOTE ON USAGE 用法:  1 It is sometimes difficult to decide whether length (adj long), width (adj wide) or depth (adj deep) is the correct term for a particular measurement. 对於物体某一边的量度, 在length (adj long)、 width (adj wide)或depth (adj deep)中选用哪个才对, 有时颇难确定. The measurements of a room or of a rectangular area or object are the length (measured along the longer sides) and the width (measured along the shorter sides) 量度房间或长方形的面积或物体, 用length（长度, 沿较长的边量得）和width（宽度, 沿较短的边量得）表示: The garage is 6 metres long and 3 metres wide. 汽车房长6米, 宽3米. When describing a piece of furniture that has a front and a back, both length and width can be used for the longer sides and depth is used for the measurement from front to back. 在形容一件有前後之分的家具时, length和width均可用以指较长的边, 而depth（深度）则指从前面到後面的尺寸. Length is generally used when the measurement of the front is much greater than that of the depth. 若前面的长短远远超过深度, 一般用length. *Width is used when the measurements of the front and of the depth are similar. 若前面的长短与深度相似, 则用width. (See illustration 见插图. )  2 Compare wide and broad. 试比较wide和broad. Wide is the more general word but broad is used of parts of the body *wide适用范围较广, broad则特指身体的部位: a broad nose 大鼻子 *  broad shoulders 宽阔的双肩. Otherwise it is more formal than wide and is often used, especially in literary language, to describe features of the landscape 在其他情况下, broad比wide更文雅, 尤其在文学语言中常用以描绘景色: a broad river 宽阔的河 *  a broad expanse of unspoilt country 一片广袤的、 自然美未受破坏的郊野.

sell
NOTE ON USAGE 用法: Compare sell, vend, peddle, push and flog. 试比较sell、 vend、 peddle、 push、 flog这几个词.  1 Sell is the most general verb, meaning `give in exchange for money' *sell使用最广, 意为｀拿东西换钱＇: They are selling their house and moving to the country. 他们打算把房子卖掉, 搬到乡下去. * Do you sell magazines here? 你们这儿卖杂志吗?2 Vend is formal and indicates the selling of small articles. *vend较文, 指出售小件商品. The noun vendor is much more common than the verb 由这个动词派生出的名词vendor, 比其动词本身较为常用: a street vendor, a news-vendor 街上的摊贩、 报贩. It is also a legal term used especially in the selling of a house *vendor还是个法律术语, 用以指房产的卖方: The vendor signs a contract with the purchaser. 卖方须与买方签订契约. Vending-machine is also common and is a coin-operated slot machine for the sale of small items. *vending-machine也较常用, 是一种投币式出售小商品的自动售货机.  3 Peddle indicates the selling of small, inexpensive goods by going from house to house *peddle指挨门挨户地推销廉价的小商品: He peddled small household articles around the town. 他在城里挨家挨户兜售日用百货.  4 Push is informal and is used for the selling of illegal drugs *push是口语用词, 指出售违禁毒品: He was caught pushing heroin to schoolchildren. 他在向小学生贩卖海洛因时被捕.  5 Flog is slang. *flog是俚语用词. It often suggests that what is to be sold is of little value, possibly stolen and therefore difficult to sell 这个词常指出售的东西无甚价值, 或可为赃物, 故难以售出: He tried to flog me a broken TV set. 他一个劲儿向我兜售一个破电视机.

NOTE ON USAGE 用法: Indefinite pronouns such as somebody, someone, everyone, no one, etc are singular and, grammatically, should be followed by othersingular pronouns (he, she, his, her, etc). *somebody、someone、 everyone、 no one等不定代词均为单数, 根据语法规则, 後面应该用其他单数代词（he、 she、 his、 her等）. Traditionally, if the sex of the person is unknown, the masculine pronouns he, him, his have been used to refer to both females and males 按照传统用法, 若性别不详则男女两性均用阳性代词he、 him、 his表示: Everybody has his own view of what happened. 对於所发生的事情, 各人有各人的看法. * Somebody has lost his car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. * Did anybody hurt himself? 有人受伤了吗? Many people today consider this shows sexual bias and try to avoid it. 如今很多人认为这种用法有性别偏见之嫌, 因而尽量加以避免. The preferred way, especially in speech, is to use they, them or their with a singular neutral meaning 较为可取的方法是使用they、 them或their, 并赋以单数的中性含义, 尤用於口语: Everyone said they would help. 大家都表示要帮忙. *  Either John or Jane has to give up their job. 不是约翰就是简, 总有一个得放弃工作. Another way, especially in writing, is to use(s)he, he or she, him or her, his or her, though some people find this clumsy 另一种方法尤见於书面形式, 是使用(s)he、 he or she、 him or her、 his or her, 但有些人认为过於累赘: Somebody has lost his or her car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. A third possibility is to rephrase the sentence to make the subject plural, thus avoiding the problem 第三种用法是修改句子, 使主语变为复数以避开这个问题: Did any of you hurt yourselves? 有人受伤了吗?
